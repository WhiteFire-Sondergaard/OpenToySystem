Open Toy System
===============

Open Toy System is a set of lsl scripts designed to provide control functionality to enhance roleplaying in second life. Specifically, it is designed to control collars, cuffs, blindfolds, and other such toys while allowing ease of use between all the toys.

*** First release is not posted yet, will update when it is. ***

Please see the wiki for the current roadmap. I am hoping to have a stable release sometime over the christmass holiday (2011) when I have time off to work on it.

Why The Fork?
=============

A combination of factors created this fork: the shutdown of the OpenCollar database that caused almost all OC based toys to break, and a desire to implement features that OpenCollar was disinterested in.
